# Quadruped
This is a personal project for an affordable 12-DOF quadruped robot, influenced by Boston Dynamic's SPOT. <br/>

## TO DO
1. 3D Model the robot on Fusion360 (COMPLETED)
2. Print and Assemble (COMPLETED)
3. Make it stand up for the first time (COMPLETED)
4. Make it walk with an opensource program via ROS 1
5. Migrate to ROS 2

If possible, I would also like to make a more compact version, and make it easier to wire via a custom PCB as well.
